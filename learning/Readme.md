### EsLint

ESLint is designed to be flexible and configurable for your use case. You can turn off every rule and run only with basic syntax validation or mix and match the bundled rules and your custom rules to fit the needs of your project. There are two primary ways to configure ESLint:

Configuration Comments - use JavaScript comments to embed configuration information directly into a file.
Configuration Files - use a JavaScript, JSON, or YAML file to specify configuration information for an entire directory and all of its subdirectories. This can be in the form of an .eslintrc.* file or an eslintConfig field in a package.json file, both of which ESLint will look for and read automatically, or you can specify a configuration file on the command line.
